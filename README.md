# High Performance Computing d2q9 Lattice Boltzmann implementation

This was a university project aimed at investigating high performance computing techniques in the context of executing a [fluid simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods) program on the university supercomputer. The first section presents a highly optimised vectorized/parallized
solution tested on a single compute node. The second section implements a distributed-parallel revision of the same program using the [MPI API](https://www.open-mpi.org/).
